<h1>Having an emergency fund saved me</h1>

<br>

<h2>June 23, 2023</h2>

<p>
  If you're into personal finance, you've heard every money guru say the same thing - "You must have an emergency fund!"
  <br>
  One of the first things every financial expert recommends for everyone is to set some money aside for a rainy day. Most of the time, the recommendation is 3-6 months of living expenses kept liquid in something like a high-yield savings account.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Because if there's one thing you can count on, it's that life will throw curveballs at you when you least expect it.
  </blockquote>
<p>
  If you're anything like me, then you hear these advices get thrown around so often that they almost become white noise. However, recently, I experienced an emergency that made be so grateful for my rainy-day reserve.
  <br>
  I was on my way home from grocery shopping when all of a sudden, my front-right tire deflated like a Macy's parade float. And instead of being a source of stress in my week, since I had my emergency fund, it was barely an inconvenience to my evening. I was only a few blocks away, so I was able to make it home on the flat, then I just called a mobile tire service to literally come to my driveway and change my tire on the spot.
  <br>
  Didn't have to worry about the cost at all. Highly recommend having that emergency fund.

  Over my next few paychecks, I'll simply replenish what was taken out of my high-yield savings account, and my emergency reserve will be fully funded once again.
